# Linux microPlatform

The Foundries.io Linux microPlatform is an extensible software and
hardware platform that makes it easier to develop, secure, and maintain
Internet-connected Linux-based embedded devices.

The Linux microPlatform is based on
[OpenEmbedded](https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page) /
[Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org), and adds a select set of board
support package layers to enable popular development boards.

Though the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org) and software used for
any of the microPlatform builds may contain out-of-tree patches or
features, a fundamental goal is to run as close to the tip, or latest
software, as possible so that users of the Linux microPlatform can
benefit from the latest changes.

In a FoundriesFactory, the Linux microPlatform is the baseline software
stack which is meant to be extended by the user. It is open source
software, and maintained by Foundries.io on
[GitHub](https://github.com/foundriesio).
