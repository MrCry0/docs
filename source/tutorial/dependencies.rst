Dependencies
============

To complete the entire tutorial, you need a workstation computer
(Linux, macOS, or Windows) and a Linux microPlatform device.

The Linux microPlatform is portable, and builds for
several boards are available. To get started easily, we recommend:

**Linux microPlatform**:

- `Raspberry Pi 3 Model B`_ or `Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+`_
- SD card compatible with Raspberry Pi 3 (see this `Embedded
  Linux wiki guide`_ for examples)
- Ethernet cable (or you can use WiFi)
- 3.3 volt USB to TTL Serial Cable, such as this `SparkFun FTDI Basic
  Breakout 3.3V`_ (optional, only needed if connecting via WiFi)
