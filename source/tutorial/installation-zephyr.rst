Install Zephyr microPlatform
============================

The Zephyr microPlatform is an extensible software platform that makes
it easier to develop, secure, and maintain Internet-connected
applications on microcontroller devices.

The Zephyr microPlatform is based on the `Zephyr`_ real-time operating
system, and the `MCUBoot`_ secure bootloader.

   Zephyr microPlatform

This document describes how to:

- Set up a Zephyr microPlatform development environment on your workstation

- Flash MCUBoot and a Zephyr application image onto a microcontroller
  device

- Boot the device, verifying that MCUBoot correctly validates and
  chain-loads the Zephyr image

.. important::

   Make sure you've obtained dependencies as described in
   :ref:`tutorial-dependencies` before continuing.

Set up Build Environment
------------------------

Select your platform for instructions:

.. content-tabs::

   .. tab-container:: linux
      :title: Linux

      1. Install dependencies for the Zephyr microPlatform.

         On Ubuntu (16.04 and up)::

           sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fio-maintainers/ppa
           sudo apt-get update
           sudo apt-get install zmp-dev
           pip3 install --user pykwalify pyelftools intelhex pyserial click \
                               cryptography --only-binary cryptography

         On other distributions, see :ref:`tutorial-zephyr-dependencies`.

      #. Install the tools you need to flash your board.

         For `BLE Nano 2`_, you'll need `pyOCD`_, which you can install with
         pip3::

           pip3 install --user pyOCD

         For the nRF DK boards, you'll need the `nRF5x Command Line Tools`_.

         For other boards, check your board's documentation.  At this time,
         the Zephyr microPlatform only supports boards that can be flashed
         with pyOCD, nrfjprog, or dfu-util's DfuSe (i.e. STM32 extensions to
         the USB DFU protocol).

      #. Install the following udev rules as root, then unplug and plug back
         in any boards you have connected::

           echo 'ATTR{idProduct}=="0204", ATTR{idVendor}=="0d28", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/50-cmsis-dap.rules

      #. Configure your username and password in Git::

           git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
           git config --global user.email "your-email-address@example.com"

      Your system is now ready to install the Zephyr microPlatform.

   .. tab-container:: macos
      :title: macOS

      We test on macOS Sierra (10.12).

      #. Install `HomeBrew`_.

      #. Install dependencies for the Zephyr microPlatform::

           brew install dtc python3 repo gpg cmake ninja
           pip3 install --user ply pykwalify pyyaml cryptography pyelftools intelhex pyserial click

      #. Install the tools you need to flash your board.

         For `BLE Nano 2`_, you'll need `pyOCD`_::

           pip3 install --user pyOCD

         For the nRF DK boards, you'll need the `nRF5x Command Line Tools`_.

         For other boards, check your board's documentation.  At this time,
         the Zephyr microPlatform only supports boards that can be flashed
         with pyOCD, nrfjprog, or dfu-util's DfuSe (i.e. STM32 extensions to
         the USB DFU protocol).

      #. Configure your username and password in Git::

           git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
           git config --global user.email "your-email-address@example.com"

      Your system is now ready to install the Zephyr microPlatform.

   .. tab-container:: windows
      :title: Windows 10 (Experimental)

      .. note::

         Due to the Zephyr microPlatform's current use of the Repo tool to
         manage multiple Git repositories, only experimental directions
         using the Windows Subsystem for Linux are provided. This is because
         Repo does not work on Windows.

         When possible, the Zephyr microPlatform will use `Zephyr's West
         tool`_ to manage repositories instead, enabling first-class Windows
         support.

      Windows versions supporting the Windows Subsystem for Linux have
      experimental support. For this to work, you will need 64 bit Windows
      10 Anniversary Update or later.

      These instructions should let you build binaries; however, flashing
      support is not yet documented.

      #. Install the `Windows Subsystem for Linux`_, then open a Bash
         window to enter commands.

      #. Change to your Windows user directory with a command like this::

           cd /mnt/c/Users/YOUR-USER-NAME

         You can press the Tab key after typing ``/Users/`` to see a list of
         user names.

         .. warning::

            Skipping this step means you won't be able to use the
            microPlatform with Windows tools like Explorer, graphical
            editors, etc.

            As documented by Microsoft, `changing files in Linux directories
            using Windows tools`_ can damage your system.

      #. We recommend making sure your Linux subsystem is up to date with
         these commands (which can take a while they first time they're run)::

           apt-get update
           apt-get upgrade

      #. Finish by following the Ubuntu Linux instructions.

.. _tutorial-zephyr-install:

Install the Zephyr microPlatform
--------------------------------

The Zephyr microPlatform can be installed in any directory on your
workstation.

The Zephyr microPlatform currently uses the Repo tool to fetch a
variety of Git repositories at known-good revisions, and keep them in
sync as time goes on. If you're new to Repo and want to know more, see
:ref:`ref-zephyr-repo`.

The latest continuous release is available to Zephyr microPlatform
subscribers from `github.com/foundriesio`_. Install it as follows.

#. Make an installation directory for the Zephyr microPlatform, and
   change into it::

     mkdir zmp && cd zmp

   (You can also reuse an existing installation directory.)

#. Install update |version| using ``repo``:

   .. parsed-literal::

      repo init -u https://github.com/foundriesio/zmp-manifest -b |repo_tag|
      repo sync

.. _tutorial-zephyr-build:

Build MCUboot and Hello World Application
-----------------------------------------

Choose your board, and run the command from the ``zmp`` directory you
made earlier:

.. content-tabs::

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_blenano2
      :title: BLE Nano 2

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp build -b nrf52_blenano2 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_pca10040
      :title: nRF52 DK (nRF52832)

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp build -b nrf52_pca10040 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

   .. tab-container:: nrf52840_pca10056
      :title: nRF52840 DK

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp build -b nrf52840_pca10056 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

In addition to the ``hello_world`` app, this builds an MCUboot binary
for your board and application.

(For more information, see :ref:`ref-zephyr-zmp-build`.)

.. important::

   The build uses a publicly available RSA key pair bundled with
   MCUBoot itself by default, for ease of demonstration (the
   key is in :file:`mcuboot/root-rsa-2048.pem`).

   This key pair is for **development use only**.

   For production, **you must generate and use your own keys**, or
   anyone will be able to sign binaries for your boards. See
   :ref:`howto-mcuboot-keys` for details.

Connect to the Board's Console
------------------------------

Next, connect to your board's console so you'll be able to see the
message printed when you flash the application in the next step.

- Make sure your board is plugged into your computer via USB. A serial
  port device (usually named ``/dev/ttyACM0`` or ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` on
  Linux, but the number may change if you've got other devices plugged
  in) should be created when the board enumerates if it supports USB
  serial.

- Open the device with your favorite serial console program\
  [#serial]_ at 115200 baud.

Flash MCUboot and the Application
---------------------------------

Now you'll flash MCUBoot and the ``hello-world`` application to your board:

.. content-tabs::

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_blenano2
      :title: BLE Nano 2

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp flash -b nrf52_blenano2 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_pca10040
      :title: nRF52 DK (nRF52832)

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp flash -b nrf52_pca10040 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

   .. tab-container:: nrf52840_pca10056
      :title: nRF52840 DK

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp flash -b nrf52840_pca10056 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

(For more information, see :ref:`ref-zephyr-zmp-flash`.)

The board's console should print messages that look roughly like this:

.. code-block:: none

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS vX.Y.Z-NN-gabcdef *****
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] main: Starting bootloader
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Image 0: magic=unset, copy_done=0xff, image_ok=0xff
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Scratch: magic=unset, copy_done=0x0, image_ok=0xff
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Boot source: slot 0
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_swap_type: Swap type: none
   [MCUBOOT] [ERR] main: Unable to find bootable image
   ***** Booting Zephyr OS vX.Y.Z-NN-gabcdef *****
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] main: Starting bootloader
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Image 0: magic=unset, copy_done=0xff, image_ok=0xff
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Scratch: magic=unset, copy_done=0x0, image_ok=0xff
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Boot source: slot 0
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_swap_type: Swap type: none
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] main: Bootloader chainload address offset: 0x8000
   [MCUBOOT] [INF] main: Jumping to the first image slot
   ***** Booting Zephyr OS vX.Y.Z-NN-gabcdef *****
   Hello World! arm

During the flashing process:

#. The chip's flash is completely erased, and MCUboot is installed. It
   is unable to find an application, since it's a fresh install.

#. The signed "hello world" application image is flashed, and the chip
   is reset.

#. MCUBoot runs out of reset, and checks the cryptographic signature
   on the application binary.

#. Since the signature is valid, MCUboot runs the application itself.

#. The application you just built will print a "Hello World" message
   on screen.

If you're using another board, you may need to do something slightly
different, but the basic idea is the same: connect a serial console at
115200 baud, and run ``zmp flash`` to flash and run the program.

Change the Application and Reflash
----------------------------------

Next, make a trivial change to the application: change "Hello World"
to "Hello Zephyr microPlatform" in
:file:`zephyr/samples/hello_world/src/main.c`.

Since you've already flashed MCUboot, you can just re-flash the
updated application to your board:

.. content-tabs::

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_blenano2
      :title: BLE Nano 2

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp flash -o app -b nrf52_blenano2 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_pca10040
      :title: nRF52 DK (nRF52832)

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp flash -o app -b nrf52_pca10040 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

   .. tab-container:: nrf52840_pca10056
      :title: nRF52840 DK

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp flash -o app -b nrf52840_pca10056 zephyr/samples/hello_world/

The console output will now end with:

.. code-block:: none

   Hello Zephyr microPlatform! arm

.. [#git-creds]

   If you don't want to do that, see
   https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials for some alternatives.

.. [#zmpwest]

   The ``zmp`` tool is optional; it's possible to build this all
   "manually" without using this tool, but instructions are not
   provided here. To see what ``zmp`` is doing, run ``zmp --debug
   COMMAND <args>`` instead of ``zmp COMMAND <args>``.

   In the future, zmp will be replaced by Zephyr's West tool.

.. [#signatures]

   Since this tutorial is meant to help you get started, the binaries
   are signed with keys that aren't secret, and **are not suitable for
   production use**.

.. [#serial]

   On Linux, with `picocom`_::

     picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0

   On Linux or macOS, with `screen`_::

     screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

   To use `PuTTY`_ on Windows, see `Connecting to a local serial
   line`_ in the PuTTY documentation.
