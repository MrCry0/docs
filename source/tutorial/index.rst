Getting Started Tutorial
========================

Start here for a step by step tutorial on how to install the
microPlatforms, then use them to set up an end-to-end IoT
demonstration system using the OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol.

.. note::

   If you are only interested in installing one of the microPlatforms,
   you can go directly to :ref:`tutorial-linux` or
   :ref:`tutorial-zephyr`.

A block diagram of this system is shown here, and though it is not
explicitly shown, one or more IoT devices can connect to the network
through the same gateway.

Using this demonstration system, you can:

- See live data readings from your devices using the Leshan web
  application

- Send commands to the device, such as turning on and off an LED

- Use Leshan to update your IoT device firmware

- Secure your network communication using the DTLS protocol

To set up and use this system, follow these pages in order.
